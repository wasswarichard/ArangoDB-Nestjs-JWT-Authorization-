## Introduction

Once a user has been authenticated via the login service, if they have sufficient access rights because of their role, they can now do the following with rules:

- Create
- Import a Draft
- Save a draft
- Delete a Draft Rule
- Disable non Draft Rules
- Review any Rule type
- Modify any Rule type
- Submit a Draft rule for Approval

This documentation assumes an understanding of the [flow of artefacts](50_flow_of_artefacts.md) and [states](51_states.md) of any event

## Rules
### Create a Rule
The service will allow for a Rule to be created

        # declare actors
        actor fe as Front End
        participant be as Backend
        participant bc as Security Bound Context
        participant db as Database
        fe->>be: Create New Rule
        be->>bc: validates User and permissions
        bc->>db: Save rule in database
        db->>be: saved Rule
        be->>fe: Saved Rule
        
```
